<h3 style="color:  #0000b3;">Personal Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name: Tim Damon</li>
<li>Student Number: S3829497</li>
<li>Email: S3829497@Student.RMIT.edu.au</li>
</ul>
<p>I am 24 years old and for most of my life have lived in a town in Victoria called Wonthaggi, except for 2 years that I moved to Melbourne to study.<br>
 In 2013 I completed my year 12 studies at Mary MacKillop College in Leongatha and since then have completed several short courses and attempted 1 longer course;<br>
 I completed a Test and Tag licence course, an RSA and RSG, 2 short courses for 5 units each in Cert III in Retail and Hospitality, and I attempted a course in Digital and Interactive Games. <br>
 My favourite hobby is playing video games, regularly with a small group of friends from the USA whom I would consider to be my closest friends, though I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows, and browsing the web. </p>
<h3 style="color:  #0000b3;">Interest in IT</h3>
<p>My interest in IT started when I was very young, maybe 4 or 5, when my Aunt introduced me to playing video games on her computer though I don’t remember all of them I do remember playing The Settlers, SimCity 2000 and Aladdin.<br>
 Since then I have always had an interest in IT though mostly through video games, but have always found myself to be able to learn IT related topics reasonably quickly.<br>
 More recently though (last year) I decided to build my first desktop computer, the process of building it gave me interest in the more technical side of IT and I figured that I’d like to more learn more about the things happen “behind-the-scenes” in IT.</p>
 <p>I had been thinking about enrolling in a new course for most of this year. One night I thought to look at courses through OUA and found these RMIT courses that seemed to be a great entry point into learning the more technical side of IT.<br>
 The next day I got a call from OUA asking if I was really interested, after a few questions I was recommended the same course I had seen the night before and right there I decided that I would try something new and this course seemed right so I enrolled.</p>
<p>I expect to learn the basics of the IT industry, how it functions, the role that it serves, and the different positions available in the industry and how they function. As well as a base learn to begin learning programming.</p>
<h3 style="color:  #0000b3;">Ideal Job</h3>
<h5><a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/738261/Senior-Gameplay-Designer">Senior Gameplay Designer at 343 Industries</a></h5>
<img src="IdealJob343.png" alt="Ideal Job Snapshot" height="500">
<p>A senior gameplay designer would have a large input in the design and feel of a video game (in this case a Halo title), creating unique and fun moments in the game for many to enjoy. Video games have alays been interest for me and<br>
 I've always loved the Halo series so to be able to have such a large part in helping to create the would be a dream of mine and as such would make this position highly appealing to me.</p>
 <h4>Experience and Skills required would include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Experience in creating and developing a video game of incredibly high quality and polish.</li>
<li>A high level of proficiency in using 1 or more text-based programming languages.</li>
<li>A high level of understanding of gameplay mechanics, and design theories and pratices.</li>
<li>A high level of proficiency in using game editing softwares</li>
<li>The Ability to work well in a team environment</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color:#0000ff;">Experience and Skills I currently possess:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Experience creating an (unfinished) entry level video game of low quality and polish</li>
<li>An low level of profiency in using 2 text-based programming languages. (C# & Java)</li>
<li>A decent level of understanding of gamplay mechanics, and some understanding of game design theories.</li>
<li>Low level of experience in using game editing software (Unity)</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="color:#0000ff;">A plan to obtain the skills required</h4>
<p>The intial skills required for an entry point to the profiency level needed for this position can be acquired through courses and other learning tools such as online tutorials and experimentation with the required tools<br>
The higher level of proficiency can really only be acquired through time and practise working in the industry and continuing to learn through various means such as through colleagues and development of your own skills.</p>

<h4 style="color:#0000ff;"><br><br>Analysis</h4>
<p>The results of these tests show to me that I am an Introverted person, who has few friends but those friend sare close friends. They also tell me that I learn best by listening and watching.<br>
 That I often make decisions based my gut feeling rather than really thinking them over. </p>
 <p>The results tell me that it may be difficult for me to work in a team of people that I don't know, but if I am comfortable with those people I can be an effective team member who is also good at<br>
 tackling individual tasks as well. I am liekly to take in information form my team if it spoken to me as well a written down.</p>
 <p>When forming a team I should try and incorporate people that I already trust if possible, and people who are effective and communicating through verbal and visual means.<br>
 It will be more difficult to find an effective team that I will work well with but once in the right team I should work excellently.</p>
<h2 style="color:  #0000b3;">My Project Idea</h2>
<p>Inspired by other apps and website my idea is a smartphone application which functions as checklist/tracker for any video games you are playing and which ones you have completed or have yet to complete.<br>
 I have 2 versions of this app in my mind, an ideal one which would require a large amount of work as well as integration's with other existing products and services as well as an online database which would sync<br>
 your profile across multiple devices and allow you to follow your friends and see their progress. And a simplified, more realistic version which would function more simply as just an offline checklist for individual users.</p>
 <p>There is a similar app that I use for TV shows and Movies (TV Time) which allows you track the TV shows that you are watching, which episodes you’ve seen and which you are yet to see, it notifies you when new episodes are<br>
 available, as well as allowing you follow your friends and see what they are watching. This is a fantastic app however I find myself wishing that I also had one that allows me to track the video games that I play as well,<br>
 I have seen several of these but they never have all the functionality that I want. So I’d like to design my ideal version of such an application.</p>
 <p>The version of my app that I’ll describe is my ideal version but I understand that many of these features may not be feasible due to my knowledge level or due to requiring integration with other large existing services.<br>
 To begin with my application would require a database of video games which could searched, most probably using a service such as IGDB (Internet Games Database <a href="https://www.igdb.com/discover">www.igdb.com</a>) to create the list as a start point. Afterwards it would<br>
 allow users to add games to their profile as either games they have completed, games they are currently playing, games that are in their backlog, or games that would like to acquire in the future (a wishlist).  Ideally I would also to<br>
 add game specific options such as things like what level/rank they are, which guild and server they play with/on or as well as achievement/trophy completion, and possibly also an LFG (Looking For Group) system to allow players<br>
 to find other players to play with. I would also ideally like an automatic system where you could link your account with other services such Steam, Xbox Live, PSN, and Nintendo to automatically add any games you have played to your<br>
 profile, as well as any achievements/trophies you have unlocked, and how long you have played each game. I would also like a “friend” system where you could add your friends and be able to see their profiles to see which games they<br>
 have finished, which they are currently playing, and which games they have on their wishlist. Perhaps having integration with the other platforms mentioned earlier to allow you to add any friends who have also linked these accounts.<br>
 It could also act as a social hub allowing to view which of your friend from any of the linked platforms is online and what they are playing at that time. Adding a price-tracker it could also keep track of the prices of games on the<br>
 digital storefronts and notify you when any games on your wishlist have gone on sale, as well as a page which shows which storefronts are having a sale and everything that is on sale. It could also link to sites such as<br>
 <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/">TrueAchivements.com</a> and <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/">TrueTrophies.com</a>, and provide guides for ingame accomplishments and other ingame tasks. As well as possible links<br>
 to sites such as <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/">howlongtobeat.com</a>, <a href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/">Systemrequirementslab.com</a> and <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/">speedrun.com</a> to provide additional information about games. The simplified, more realistic version of my app would obviously strip back a lot of the more ambitious<br>
 features and just keep the games checklist, the game status (Completed, playing, backlog, want) and hopefully the online profile and friend functionality.</p>
 <p>Most obviously it would require a PC and an IDE to write to code for such a project, as well as a smartphone to test and run the application. Additionally it would require several different existing API’s including the IGDB,<br>
 Xbox Live, PSN, Steam and a price tracker. I am sure that it would require many more things that I am unaware of at this moment.</p>
 <p>It would require a decent understanding of one of several different coding languages and the proficiency in using an IDE to write said code in order to create the framework for the application. It would would also require the<br>
 ability to acquire and integrate several different API’s into the app for the outside resources required for the more ambitious aspects. I believe a simplified version of this app could be quite feasible to acquire all the skills<br>
 and software to create as what is required for the primary function should be reasonably attainable; the IGDE is available for anyone to use though it may cost. However my more ideal version is much less feasible as it requires<br>
 cooperation from several large existing companies and is unlikely to be available for anyone to be able to use.</p>
 <p>This app would be a great tool for gamers to use to keep track of which games they have played, which they are currently playing and which they still need to complete. Ideally this app would be a “one-stop-shop” for most video<br>
 information that you would need and become an important companion to gamers around the world.</p>
